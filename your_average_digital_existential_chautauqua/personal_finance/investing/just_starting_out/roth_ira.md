# What a Roth IRA Says About You - Also, How Do You Open a Roth IRA? Planning For Retirement is Fun! Aha


Honestly, when someone asks me what one of the most attractive quality I find in a person is, nine times out of ten my answer is going to be the way they treat their future self.  And one of the best ways to take care of your future self (IMO) is investing (up to) 6000 of those sweet sweet post-tax dollars you made this year into a Roth IRA certified brokerage account.  Now here is the rub:

**What makes a Roth IRA so great?**

There are many alternative vehicles to retirement other than the Roth IRA, so why  am I recommending this specific one?  The main advantage of the Roth IRA, to my knowledge, is it's tax treatment-- of course, tax laws could change at the whim of a new congress, but we assume that accounts under the current state of the laws will be honored. The tax treatment is thus: contribute post-tax funds (income that you earned that has been taxed today), and any withdrawal after retirement age is completely tax free.  One and done. Why is that such an advantage? If you are young with a relatively long road ahead toward retirement the more time your investment has to accumulate gains, experiencing that snowball effect we call compounding.  Those compounded gains may be withdrawn tax free.

Just to illustrate an example: in a typical decade, the market is said to double.  Given 40 years, a $6000 investment you make this year could be worth about $100,000!  Compare that to the $6,000 investment made with just 10 years to accumulate, which is worth $12,000 when it comes time to start making withdrawals. Maybe you're sitting in front of your computer now, in your mid 20's, early on in your career, and maybe retirement age seems like it's an alternate timeline away.  A completely separate reality from now-- or maybe it's something you know is important but you'll put it off until you're like... old or something. Once it starts to feel pressing. As long as considerations are being made, I am fine with this, but this diminishes the greatest weapon we have at our disposal: time!

Another consideration is your current tax bracket.  Do you see yourself significantly increasing your income in your 30's, 40's, 50's?  Contributing post-tax dollars in your high income earning years will cost you the most on your road to retirement.  You want to take advantage of your situation as well as you can.  Make it easy on yourself.  The earlier you start saving, the more likely you are to have a fighting chance at a comfortable income to retire to.

Here are some considerations to make before parking your funds in any retirement account:

**Is it AT ALL likely that you will need these funds in the near to medium term future?**

If yes => DON'T park your funds in the retirement space!  Keep them in savings.  Establishing a liquid emergency fund covering at least a few months of expenses is priority 1A.

If no => park those funds baby.

**Are you environmentally conscious with a profound hatred for the big corporations and could not possibly, in good conscience, contribute to their continued welfare in society?**

If yes => you may sacrifice a few percentage points off your cumulative returns in the long term, but rest assured, your soul remains intact! There are index funds dedicated to investing in the clean energy sector.  There are also indexes of companies strictly adhering to socially conscious principles.  The world is changing!  The market adapting! You can literally put your money where your mouth is.  It's truly one of the most powerful statements you can make.

If no => Invest in total stock market index funds w/ the option to donate to reduce your carbon emission contributions to net zero at a later date.

Are you just starting out in your career, owe a dauntingly sized student debt, or are exhausting yourself just to make ends meet and contributing (up to) $6000 is a massive chunk of change which simply isn't in the cards right now?

If yes => don't fret.  Take care of what you can.  And take care of yourself-- the most important asset of all-- first! To initialize the manifestation of change is to be aware of what's out there.  Keep retirement in your thoughts. Be driven by the opportunity to invest at a young age. But again, there's no use in making a hard tradeoff here, take care of the you that is here and now.  All else will fall into place.

**How do you open an account?**

Open an online brokerage account with Vanguard or Fidelity.  I am not a financial advisor but I cannot recommend online accounts enough.  The philosophy behind Vanguard (and I think Fidelity has followed suit here) is that indexes outperform managed portfolios over the long term.  Not only do indexes perform better than managed money by capturing the overall market growth in lieu of statistical anomalies (i.e. individual stock picks), but because they are relatively straightforward investments, the fees for doing so are the lowest in the business.  It's 2020 baby, get with the times! We're online.  We're getting the lowest fees money can buy! Information is as perfect as it's ever been.  This is no Wolf of Wall Street rodeo.  We're talking retirement. Retirement!  It's boring.  It's slow.  It's passive... but it works.

**Are there barriers to entry to consider?**

Yes - many of the mutual funds at Vanguard and Fidelity have $3000 minimums, which, starting out, generally limits your available options.  BUT there are target year funds (which adjust portfolio allocations to lower risk as the maturity date nears) offered for $1000 minimum.  This means that in your first year of contributions, you can select at most two funds.  Beyond the initial minimums, the world becomes your oyster-- but it takes time to build up that capital, particularly when you are limited to $6000/year in contributions.

**A note on investing _approach_**

Saving for retirement is truly a patient man's game. There will be years that are fruitless. At times, your risk tolerance will be tested. I think the best advice out there is to stay the course. Trying scenarios will happen, we've got the history to prove it. A passive long term approach (as retirement saving should be!), nearly always outperforms the reactionary, emotion-based approach.

**How far does forward thinking get you when nothing is guaranteed?**

Woah! Existential much? I think the fundamental question you need to ask yourself -- which will awaken or dampen your sense of urgency toward retirement saving, especially at a young age, can be boiled down to four words: "How certain are you?" There are an infinite number of scenarios that may play out in your life, and anyone with a lick of sense knows that their expectation of what's to come in 10, 20, or 30 years will be a far cry from the truth.  Will you factor in your belief that the country is trending toward socialism, that government will subsidize the care of our old, mangled bodies?  Or will you lean towards self-reliance?  Perhaps hedge middle? How will you factor what that $6000 means to you today?  What are you actively giving up in order to build certainty?  Any sacrifices other than budget?  The issue, like so many of life's issue sets, is complex, and yet we are intuitive estimators.  It's in our blood.  Life is not completely unpredictable, and we humans tend to rise to the occasion of the goals that we set for ourselves. Forward thinking allows us to be aware that we need these goals in place.  This is critical to making balanced estimations.  Tomorrow is not guaranteed, nor the next day, but we are very capable of balancing tomorrow's needs with today's so long as we are aware of tomorrow.

**The market is hot for saving!**

In short, investing => HOT!!

Looking in the eyes of the slightly grayer, perhaps less elongated version of yourself and saying "I got you, I did this for YOU.  Now enjoy a crack at 18 on the links, on me." => HAWT!!

Saving with consideration for how you're relationship with money will change as you grow older and your means and values continue to develop over time => HOTÂ²

**The long and the short of it**

The Roth IRA is your vehicle to the future, and I have to say, you look good riding in it! ;)

It's an ideal path for the majority of young people, particularly those who are just starting out in their careers. Of course, there are endless alternatives, more advanced strategies, but all that comes after breaking in to the investing world with the Roth IRA.

If you are considering your options, or are just starting out and would like a more personal approach given your situation, reach out! I will try my best to help or refer you to those who can. No frills attached!
