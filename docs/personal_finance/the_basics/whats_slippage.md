# What's Slippage???

Another one of those random terms in the trader lexicon > Where does it come from? What does it mean?

## What's the Slip
Slippage is the difference between the expected price and the execution price of an order that has filled.

During the delay between when the price of an asset is broadcast to a trader's/investor's screen to the time the trader/investor submits an order to the time the brokerage receives and queues the order (if the order is limit) or executes a match (if the order is market) there is potential for a change in price. This can go for or against the trader/investor. Most experienced traders attribute this to random volatility and move on with their day, others will take to reddit to attempt to defame the brokerage for the price movement out of their favor!

Slippage is a part of trading, particularly if you are primarily a market ["taker"](./whats_bid_ask_pricing.md). Latency between a trader's computer and a brokerage's server will always be non-zero and so slip is unavoidable. There are ways to minimize latency and thus reduce your expected slippage but they involve parking your personal server as close to the brokerage's as possible, and that will not be cheap.

Happy Trading!
