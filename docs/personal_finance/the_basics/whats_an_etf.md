# What's an ETF???

The people need to know what an ETF is! > Do I know what an ETF is? > Sure, but
do I know it well enough to explain the difference between it, a publically
traded stock, or a mutual fund?? > Ah shit, time to dig into the investopedia
guide I guess.

***The short of it - ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund!***

**Now what is an exchange traded fund?**
It is similar to a stock in that it can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange.

Prices fluctuate up and down. From the outside looking in, an ETF exemplifies the same behaviors as a stock might.

It diverges in that the ETF may hold multiple underlying assets. These assets usually conform to a common theme. Examples of themes may be a Bond ETF - which holds a portfolio of bonds of various maturities and types. An ETF may hold stocks which mirror popular indexes, like the S&P 500 (see SPY). They may also select an allocation of stocks or bonds in a specific industry! Additionally, ETFs open the door for retail traders (individuals, probably much like yourself) to commodities and short selling. Products like oil, gold, and crops such as coffee beans or corn become available for you to trade. Prior to ETFs, access was mostly limited to professional traders, banks, and high dollar clients.

Expense Ratios: If you are not familiar with the fee structure of funds, this may come as a surprise. The expense ratio is the amount charged you by the fund to cover management expenses.  Depending on how "active" management for the fund is, this fee can vary from 0-2% typically. Most "passively" managed funds, such as the popular index fund mirroring ETFs, will be far lower - in the 0.05-0.25% range. The expense ratio is expressed as a yearly percentage. It is not an upfront cost to the investor upon purchase, but an expense incurred for holding over time. This is to say that the investor will not see the expense ratio deducted from their investment directly.

***Some pros***
- Market access: ETFs bring retail traders access to markets that might not be available to them otherwise.

- Lower commissions: The ETF allows the investor to sell part or all of their position for a single commission, whereas if they were to attempt to replicate the holdings of the ETF (in most cases multiple holdings), this would result in multiple transactions and thus higher commission cost.

- Benchmark ETFs that mirror index funds offer broader diversification than single stock allocations.

- Offer a simple solution for investors to gain portfolio exposure outside the United States (through funds that offer international bonds and equities) while avoiding the tax complications.

***Some Cons***
- Market access: ETFs bring retail traders access to markets they may have little knowledge or experience with. This is particularly the case I've found with leveraged ETFs (often ETNs, Exchange Traded Notes). Leverage here implies the use of options to magnify (1.5x, 2x, 3x) the daily return of the underlying asset.  This is often used in commodities trading since movements in commodities are more often cyclical and less volatile than equities, but more so than bonds. The risk/reward of leveraged ETFs is often understated and I would advise any investor not familiar with these products to be cautious.

- Liquidity: Before purchasing an ETF analyze its daily volume.  The ETF space produces many ETFs that are very niche, and thus susceptible to liquidity issues when it comes time to buy or sell, and might also be subject to market manipulation tactics that would not otherwise be found trading the underlying asset(s).  That being said, generally this should not be an issue when trading common ETFs as a retail trader.

Happy Trading!
