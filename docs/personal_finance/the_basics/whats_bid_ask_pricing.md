# What's Bid/Ask Pricing???

Bid/Ask pricing is confusing as hell. I buy at the ask and sell at the bid? What? > I need to define market pricing structure before detailing how orders "fill" > Vaboom. Let's talk about Bid/Ask pricing and spreads!

## Pricing Is Like An Auction
To every transaction on the market, there is one "maker" - the party making an offer - and there is one "taker" - the party accepting the maker's offer.  To become a maker, the party may place a [limit order](./whats_an_order.md), or an offer at a certain price. It is then up to "takers" to determine the market direction using market orders.  A "taker" agrees to purchase an asset at the lowest available offer price, or sell an asset at the highest available offer price. This allows for the most efficient market possible.

## What is a bid?
A bid price is the highest price being offered among the market's *BUY* [limit orders](./whats_an_order.md) at a given moment.

## What is an ask?
An ask price is the lowest price being offered among the market's *SELL* [limit orders](./whats_an_order.md) at a given moment.

## What is a spread?
In the equity and equity adjacent markets (stocks, cashs, futures, NOT bond, NOT options), a spread is the difference between the lowest ask price and the highest bid price. In nearly all scenarios, this should be greater than zero.  If the spread were theoretically less than zero, the market would clear these orders as the buy and sell orders should be matched at a price agreeable to both the purchaser and the seller.

## What makes a good spread?
An investor/trader should analyze a brokerages' past history when it comes to spreads, as the spread informs the investor/trader how liquid an asset is on the brokerage - i.e how many interested buyers and sellers exist in the marketplace.  Many brokerages, as dealers, inflate the spread as a fee to customers for their part in making the market. Spreads most effect customers generating a high volume of transactions.  The optimal market has a low spread - this is because a low spread grants the investor/trader more freedom to buy and sell as they choose for a minimal price penalty. A low spread over long periods of time tells the investor that there is ample liquidity in the market, which allows "takers" the expectation of "stable" prices when they go to execute their order. This is because there is a steady stream of interested market participants. It is particularly important to analyze increases and decreases in the spread during periods of high volatility, such as earnings events or federal reserve meeting minutes.  The spread serves as an overall barometer for the health of a market.

Happy Trading!
