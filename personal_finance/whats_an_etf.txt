# What's an ETF???

The people need to know what an ETF is! > Do I know what an ETF is? > Sure, but
do I know it well enough to explain the difference between it, a publically
traded stock, or a mutual fund?? > Ah shit, time to dig into the investopedia
guide I guess.

The short of it - it's an Exchange Traded Fund!
