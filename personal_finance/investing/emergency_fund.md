# On the Path To Proper Allocation: The Emergency Fund

For investors who are beginning their investing journey, the emergency fund is the place to start. The emergency fund is a liquid account - cash or cash-like - that is used to defend against any unexpected, unforeseen expenses that might arise. Some example use cases for the emergency fund include being layed off from a job, a debilitating illness, a dental examination gone awry, a broken a/c unit in your home, a global pandemic(!), a myriad of other possible reasons.

An emergency fund might take the form of a savings or checking account, a money market account, a short term certificate of deposit (CD), bills stuffed under the mattress, etc.

In regards to size, a general rule of thumb is the emergency fund should supply between three to six months of living expenses. Of course, this can range wildly from individual to individual, and depends upon personal risk tolerance, current financial situation - debts, other investments and their varying liquidity levels.

> *Scenario: An investor has a completely liquid (cash) savings account holding one month worth of expenses and an additional five months worth of expenses in a high yield money market account, "high yield" meaning at or close to inflation rates (haha). The five months worth of expenses in the money market account may take 10 business days to transfer via the ACH system to the checking account where it is needed, but this is ok because at least one month of expenses is covered in the savings account, which can be transferred at the click of a button.*

# *The Tradeoff*
An investor's mindset should be to chase the highest reward to risk ratio available. This is sometimes referred to as chasing yields - but the emergency fund offers a negligible yield! In fact, most investors would consider an emergency fund a net loss in terms of yield, since cash accounts lose value to inflation, in 2021 at least!

For the up and coming investor, the reward for building out an emergency fund, this first piece of the portfolio jigsaw, is peace of mind. From a behavioral perspective, having funds for unexpected life events allows the investor to take these events in stride.  Often, the event itself is highly stressful and/or emotional.  Were it not for the emergency fund, the investor finds themself against the wall, having to consider between high interest debt options - such as credit cards and unsecured loans, or is forced to reach out to friends and family, which, while the terms of such a loan might not have significant financial cost, burdens the investor with a high social cost.  Neither of these options are good options! Having no other option to choose from, the investor accepts the terms and prolongs their journey to financial freedom - fighting off debt is an uphill battle!

> *The cost of this peace of mind comes at the loss of yield for the value of the emergency fund holdings. If an investor spends $2,000/month and wants to have 6 months of savings in cash, this comes to $12,000 in their checking account. Consider that the expectation for yields is 0% in the checking account, and 10% per year if the money were to be parked in an index fund. At the end of one year, the value of the emergency fund remains $12,000. In the hypothetical scenario where the money were parked in a diversified index fund and the index fund yielded exactly as expected, the value of that investment is now $13,200 - a difference of $1,200. This means that the investor should feel at worst indifferent to "paying" $1,200 for peace of mind. For most investors - who are averse to risk of losing everything they own - this should be a trivial decision.*
