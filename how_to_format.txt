# how_to_format.txt

Format guidelines:

Broad topics that may contain multiple avenues => create or find an existing
directory.

Create a .txt file which will contain the contents of the ramble if the
media is text else just submit the file.

For text files, state the file name as the question with _ replacing spaces.
At the top of the file, create a chain separated by > to delineate how the
idea or thought process came about.

Ex.

# how_to_format.txt

An easy to read thought process to provide context before reading sounds nice!
> How can I simplify and standardize that? > How about a format guide?

Also, try to not go beyond the 80 character line limit.

Unfinished thoughts and placeholders are encouraged in commits because they
shed light on the underlying thought process.
