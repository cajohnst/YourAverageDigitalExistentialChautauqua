# Reddit Super PAC

> *In the wake of r/WallStreetBets, it is evident that online communities can have a direct influence on real world outcomes.
What is the source of political power? Organization.*

**Step 1:** Create the reddit super pac subreddit

**Step 2:** Deliberate over a set of issues that are important enough to a key group of reddit users but the law has given a competitive advantage to corporations because of their ability to lobby/organize.

**Step 3:** Critical to passing, and often why corporations perform better in terms of the law, is organization. Create structure that is simple, allows for democratically elected leadership (moderators), forums for discussion of issues to be raised, filters trolls, etc.

**Step 4:** Hire a lobbyist.

**Step 5:** Present versions of our written laws to US Representatives

**Step 6:** See that the law passes and it benefits the majority if not all citizens.

**Step 7:** Repeat? Such is the nature of law-making.
