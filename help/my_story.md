# The Second Mountain and Cascading Depth - My Story
College ends
Internship I had for a year and a half tells me I did not get the full time role I had applied for despite being the "most qualified" and familiar with the role, having been the only one working with them for a year and a half, majoring in the most competetive fields at the most competetive university out of the applicants. This drama sent me into somewaht of a tailspin.

I decided I want to go my own route. The first few months feel ok, I felt I was "ahead" of my friends who had not taken a set path - grad school or fellowships or finance trajectories.  Then after about a year, I started feeling the ground shake beneath me. I could not rely on my friends to be supportive as I could in college. We had found our collective footing at that point, and that meant heading in separate directions for most of us.

Layers to my psyche start to reveal themselves, I am not so sure of my footing anymore. I have a job, it doesn't pay well, but it is literally my passion project.

Hard time adjusting, creating a new life with new friends. How do I make friends? I work with two guys completely remote, they live in California and the UK, I live in North Carolina. Neither of them are my age or relate to me in any way other than the project we are working on together.

I have a small family. Stretched as far apart as can be in the US - Florida, Arizona, California. We are very jovial together but usually keep to a once a year (or twice if we are lucky) routine. Vacation is expensive afterall.

Discover the second mountain - to be accepted I need to "realize the value of community". When you give to your community, your community reciprocates that love back.  What I did not know was how to ask for it. I made a point of reaching out to friends first, always saying yes to plans, I was socially starved.

Dating was hopeless. It had not been a priority in college, mostly because nearly all my friends were in stable long term relationships, did not see the value in going out to socialize. I felt my only avenue was the apps. And what a terrible route of my self-esteem those turned out to be!

"Just be yourself", "The right person will come when you aren't looking".
It became alarmingly clear to me that not only was this NOT true, but I could go my entire life without finding someone if I did not put forth the effort into finding them myself. I was invisible, despite doing what I thought was expected of me - good job, active, passionate about what I do, intelligent, a little quirky but whatever.

About a year after graduating, these feelings of isolation eroded me down to nothing, I felt starved for attention without being able to ask for it. A man does not admit such a thing! He internalizes his feelings, takes the situation on for himself, and corrects it.  That did not happen. I felt trapped, like each passing day was converging on complete social isolation.

It became clear that my passion project was also an overly complex, ambitious work, that, while original, would never see light of day. I continued working despite this, channeling all of my social frustration at these impossible problems.

I began to notice what I now know are beginning signs of depression in myself. I lacked the restraint to avoid junk foods. I drank absorbitent amounts of caffeine. Had no sleep schedule to speak of. Stopped showering. Wore plain, baggy clothes that would impress no one.

I have had Crohn's Disease since the age of six. I have considered myself fortunate to have escaped the brunt of what the disease has to offer. I have heard of cases far worse than my own.  Nonetheless, after a CT scan showed serious inflammation, my doctor advised having a small sliver of bowel removed surgically.  Since the age of six, this had been a possibility, it had always given me nightmares - thoughts of going under the knife and such. And the scar the surgery would leave! I could not bear to have a scar. I was so afraid of how it would "deform" my abdomen. How would I be able to take off my shirt in front of people at the beach? Christ.  Although the surgery was not urgent, it would happen as soon as possible. I accepted it right away. My mom, sitting next to me on the inclined patient's bed, was shocked. She didn't understand why I was seemingly indifferent to the situation. At first, I attributed it to my own strength. I was a little bit proud that I could accept this without batting an eye. I had grown! What I realized was that - actually - I had accepted this because I was indifferent, I no longer cared about myself. I had dissociated my mind from my body and was no longer afraid of what would happen to me.  I had let go, but at a cost I had not fully realized.


Championship game, feeling of being left behind - even though I definitely could not ask my friends to miss what was happening on Franklin Street for me, I felt a little bit sad no one did voluntarily. I don't ask for things, I was a few days recovery away from being able to go myself, but the thought of showing up to a mosh pit of folks climbing trees, jumping over flaming couches and the like sent my insides curling. I decided to watch from home, and wished my friends good luck on Franklin.


I sat there wallowing in my Frank Ocean, staring at the front door of the house. A wreath still hung on the blue door from Christmas (it was April, I believe). The front rooms of the house were never used, had no furniture - I had always been of the opinion that the house was uncomfortably big for two people. I parked my car for thirty seconds, staring past the thin white curtains into those hauntingly empty front rooms, and cried. It was a silent cry - like I had never cried before.  My mind was screaming, howling. Nothing audible arose. I beat my hands over the steering wheel until they were numb. Why would I go through so much - pain, exhaustion, loneliness, distress - to fix something that was broken? Why was *I* worth all of that effort? In that moment, I let myself feel the shock of finding out that this man had killed himself. I allowed myself to feel the pain that I knew my friend was feeling after losing his dad - who had raised him almost exclusively. The worst feeling I allowed myself to feel was that man's pain. I knew it, or perhaps I projected my own pain onto him. I felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness and impending dread for persisting on as I felt society had conditioned me to live - as if I could not live the life I wanted to live and be able to ask the world to support my endeavors. I allowed the thoughts in my head to connect to the physical pain, soaring waves of aching hollowness in my lower abdomen pulling on the stitches and glue that held me together with every exhale.

It was not that my friends had let me down. My friends were moving on at their own pace - many had chosen set paths. I had been warned that this would happen after college. We were all on our own paths to self-determinism, it would be unfair to demand of them the same level of friendship as we had in school.

It was not that the world had a particular vendetta against me. The world was full of empty platitudes - each paired with its own contradiction

I even felt particularly strongly that I had not let myself down. I had chosen the freedom which comes with choosing my own path.  The freedom came with crippling anxiety over which was the "right" move forward. It was unreasonable for me to have known that this would happen, I had never experienced such freedom and such emptiness!

There was no one to blame, life was not for me.

After a few long breaths, I realized that I was allowing my pain to have more agency than it deserved, turned the car around and did not look back.

My body hasn't quit, so why should I?
