# The Second Mountain and Cascading Depth - My Story

I sat there wallowing in my Frank Ocean, staring at the front door of the house. A wreath still hung on the blue door from Christmas (it was April, I believe). The front rooms of the house were never used, had no furniture - I had always been of the opinion that the house was uncomfortably big for two people. I parked my car for thirty seconds, staring past the thin white curtains into those hauntingly empty front rooms, and cried. It was a silent cry - like I had never cried before.  My mind was screaming, howling. Nothing audible arose. I beat my hands over the steering wheel until they were numb. Why would I go through so much - pain, exhaustion, loneliness, distress - to fix something that was broken? Why was *I* worth all of that effort? In that moment, I let myself feel the shock of finding out that this man had killed himself. I allowed myself to feel the pain that I knew my friend was feeling after losing his dad - who had raised him almost exclusively. The worst feeling I allowed myself to feel was that man's pain. I knew it, or perhaps I projected my own pain onto him. I felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness and impending dread for persisting on as I felt society had conditioned me to live - as if I could not live the life I wanted to live and be able to ask the world to support my endeavors. I allowed the thoughts in my head to connect to the physical pain, soaring waves of aching hollowness in my lower abdomen pulling on the stitches and glue that held me together with every exhale.

It was not that my friends had let me down. My friends were moving on at their own pace - many had chosen set paths. I had been warned that this would happen after college. We were all on our own paths to self-determinism, it would be unfair to demand of them the same level of friendship as we had in school.

It was not that the world had a particular vendetta against me. The world was full of empty platitudes - each paired with its own contradiction

I even felt particularly strongly that I had not let myself down. I had chosen the freedom which comes with choosing my own path.  The freedom came with crippling anxiety over which was the "right" move forward. It was unreasonable for me to have known that this would happen, I had never experienced such freedom and such emptiness!

There was no one to blame, life was not for me.

After a few long breaths, I realized that I was allowing my pain to have more agency than it deserved, turned the car around and did not look back.

My body hasn't quit, so why should I?
