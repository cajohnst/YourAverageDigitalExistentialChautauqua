# ID Check At the Door

identity is congitively heavy.
Life should be light.  Remove the possibility of an afterlife can be confusing, because the afterlife is a simple appeal to hope. We are accustomed to hope, existentialism at first does not provide any.  Becoming comfortable with the idea of nothing, zero. I initially rejected the idea because it was SO uncomfortable. My life needed meaning, we are so entrenched in the Aristotelean idea of final causation, we can't imagine life any other way.
