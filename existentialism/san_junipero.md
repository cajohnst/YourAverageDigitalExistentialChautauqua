As technology consistently improves the lives of humans, our life spans are lengthened, sickness, fatal errors are systematically removed, our risk profiles change, this leads to changes in behavior -> leads to changes in events/outcomes.

Obviously could no longer regard self as human - humanity is shaped by our ultimate failing in overcoming our environment.

Hypothetical: We have the ability to upload consciousness to the cloud?

Immortalize our metaphysical selves? - Does the separation from our physical bodies change our risk profile? Following this thought, what kind of version of ourselves would we be if there was no underlying repercussion of danger?  Can we possibly regard ourselves as having "the same" conscious body?

How much of our internal decision making stems from avoiding "death"?
