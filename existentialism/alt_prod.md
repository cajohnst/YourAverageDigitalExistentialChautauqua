# Alt Prod: Alternative to a life lived for productivity is a life lived for curiosity

## Is this true or just sounds good?
## Why might a life not lived for productivity lead to minimalism?
Why do we place a high value on productivity?
Analyzing the events/outcomes of a "productive" society? Lack of empathy for "non-productive" individuals.

I think the common slippage is to associate non-productive with lazy. It comes from a place where productivity is necessary for survival. But who is doing all that work, really?  This will be a controversial opinion, but I believe that most jobs are irrelevant to survival. We have leveraged technology in such a way as to wield immense resources with relatively little of our own societal effort. Most of the jobs of today arise out of the necessity for balance, we must convince ourselves that we need to expend our mental and physical efforts in order to "earn" our livelihood.  This is no longer true in Western society. Not that I am condoning laziness.

Is empathy independent of value? aka "conditional" love, brings about anxiety, fear of abandonment

Does meritocracy see humans as the masters of ideas and inventions, thus rewarding outcomes that are more or less arbitrary outcomes of a system that are more or less arbitrary. Are humans more or less the connecting node between idea and the physical world? Right place right time is rewarded? But wealth is preserved because scarcity, "loss-aversion" is programmed into our genes. Shouldn't our systems be designed to override that? Would inventors really be disinclined to produce new ideas without the financial reward? My thought is, while there may be an initial shock, actually ideas are like viruses, they will spread regardless of the reward. They will find a new way to mutate. Wouldn't capital sharing be more beneficial if more humans benefited from the resources it generates?

-- Enter curiosity: the best scientists will tell you this is there primary driver anyway. Curiosity is exploration of ideas without a particular goal in mind. It is passive, observational approach.

I actively promote passive income strategies. This is how I generate income. I in no way earned any of that income with my physical labor. You can argue that an idea has monetary value, but why would it? Kind of insane that it has come to that?
