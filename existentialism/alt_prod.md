# Alt Prod: Alternative to a life lived for productivity is a life lived for curiosity

## Is this true or just sounds good?
## Why might a life not lived for productivity lead to minimalism?
Why do we place a high value on productivity?
Analyzing the events/outcomes of a "productive" society? Lack of empathy for "non-productive" individuals.

Is empathy independent of value? aka "conditional" love, brings about anxiety, fear of abandonment
