# A Philosophy of Love

Zen, God, bounded rationality,arete? The Greeks

All points to one thing - to be known.

The system set up - bounded rationality, imperfect information

Cognitive psychology says our brains are constantly looking to solve systems, to know them

What makes a good lover - a good listener, a curious person, observational

What we are seeking is the truth, what we can hope is to converge on objective reality

Why do we so often mistake love for a need to feel validated?
It’s a systems check

The metaphysics - I have one system, you are a completely independent system, my system holds memory for ideas and attributes about you, yours holds ideas and attributes about me.


Sex is not love. There is sexual love.

Is love the lowest common denominator such as Paul says?

I think at our current evolutionary standpoint, it is a priority because validation is such an important aspect to our psyche. It is very possible that we could evolve past the need for love, since computers might make it possible to know all information at once, they might remove the bounded rationality constraint required for love

I think it is so easy to see in the streets, during the aids crisis because to care takes us toward knowing, and it is difficult to care for those that we have little hope of seeing reciprocating from. Why get to know someone for little to nothing in return? It is a cognitive “waste” if we consider our brains running like a computer.

The computer wants to do the least amount of processing possible.

Saying I love you means that you not only acknowledge the others system, you accept it as is and you KNOW it. Don’t say I love you before knowing the system!

I think love often gets intertwined with validation and attraction. The lifelong partner narrative that the hallmark channel presents us with, love is this journey fueled by sexual desire to find a lifelong partner. The subsequent discovery is paired with a release of endorphins and we call that love.

In our hearts we know this is hollow, and that’s because we are identifying events as structure, when they are just events. While events/outcomes are positive signals, it is better to analyze the underlying behavior which can be used to identify and KNOW the structure of the system. This is the fullest 4d method of knowing a system we have, until we are uploading our consciousness and memory to the cloud, that is. Which will replace our need for God.

Love is not always selfless, in fact it is typically not. It can often be found when interests align because the determined “reward” is greater

Love is the key to existentialism, where there is no purpose or meaning

Know thyself, self-love, later article?

To know is the replicator of mind as the dna or rna is the replicator of the biological world. To know is to preserve

Obstacles: how can I observe your system without interacting with it. Romantic love love between two minds is different in that we must observe how two systems interact from the vantage point of one of the systems involved.

If you want be beloved -

You need to be vulnerable - open to being known.

If you are a lover -

You need to be patient, curious, observational?
How you formulate another is vital. Do not overhype, do not set up expectations that are not true. Do not build the beloved to be something it is not.

The metadata shows that something that is understood will be valued higher than the same thing if it were not. And we did all that work to learn the system! A system that is familiar is inherently more useful to the lover than a system that is not familiar.

Shakespeare and the metaphysical poets are obsessed with this idea of preserving their lover (at times themselves) in the written language. To be known in this way, the "meme" may enter the common mind and live on. The poem is a replicator

To love is to know. To *love* is to *know*.

My ninth grade pre-calculus teacher once announced to the class as the final tardy bell rang for fourth period, without provocation, a half-smirk perched upon his face - "Gentleman! Love is a verb." The classroom filled with uncomfortable silence as we racked our brains trying to decipher what he could possibly be talking about. *He's talking about fucking* - was my immediate thought. But as he held our collective gaze for approximately five seconds, and him being the only "adult" in the room, I gathered that he might be hinting at something more clever. He continued on the lecture at that point



## Love is Above All
Love is the meta trait that we hold above all? But why? To love is to know.

Systems - outcomes -> beliefs -> structures. To know is to understand the structure of a system - its weaknesses, its leverage points, how it interacts with outside systems, its extended phenotypes.

Investment -> Scarcity built into the biological world. Evolution has provided us with bounded rationality, an imperfect perception of the world. We are gifted sensation powerful enough to survive. It is data processing "optimized" - we do not often see far beyond what we need to - this goes for our physical sensations as well as internal thought processes - particularly from the reflective ("automatic") system.  We behave irrationally because it was not biologically necessary for it to be so! Because of bounded rationality, we conduct cost-benefit analyses on all of our mental processes. Therefore, there is significant investment required in familiarizing oneself with a particular system (which is only a mental model). There is a cognitive cost! Time resources and opportunity costs also come into play.

Computer Science/ Applied Statistics -> We cannot know reality, but we can attempt to make estimates based on outcomes which predicts underlying behavior. Through analyzing many subjective outcomes, using hypothesized behavioral parameters, we "converge" on objectivity.  Our brains inherently do this when we make decisions. We make expectations based on a mental projection of reality - influenced by our past experience.

Biology - Dawkins and memes -> Systems are better than memes. Systems are models that have taken on a life of their own. They replicate from one mind to another and travel and mutate to a degree far greater than the biological replicator. It only takes one game of telephone to figure out why.

Metaphysics - There exists within my mind a projection

Do other animal species love?

## What follows from love?
To say "I love you" is therefore an expression of knowledge that carries significant implications. To acknowledge a system is to take some responsibility for it.  In the replicator metaphor, it means to sustain that system as it appears to you. Actionable responsibility follows. Caring. Nurturing. These require responsibility, commitment. To preserve the system requires kindness. All of those other traits in Corinthians can be born from this one. Love is above all.

## Where does love find the energy?
Sexual love - to know another's body in an intimate way, the energy required comes from attraction.

Familial love - I think is often developed slowly over time. Due to the natural tendency for family to be in close proximity.

Philial(?) love - Pure in that there is no social contract for friendship. Secondary and Third level brain rewards for companionship as social animals.
*Why is it taboo to tell your friends you love them?*

Object(?) love - Curiosity. Spare energy? Desire to know the world as it is, not how we wish to perceive it? Desire for truth maybe?

## Where would love most likely be found?
To be frank, we find love exactly where one might expect if they had never heard of the concept. To know requires a huge amount of cognitive energy, so we find it most often in relationships that come with the biggest biological replicator rewards first. Sexual partners, family. Then comes friends and pets to satisfy secondary biological rewards in companionship. Thirdly we might find love in other systems - be it person, place, thing, concept. This feels like a natural hierarchy to me.

## Ignorance (and lovelessness) is bliss
It is less of a burden to not know, to not love, than to know, to love. To know and love subjects the knower and lover to the responsibility of using that knowledge and love as it was presented to them, to the best of their ability.

## To be a Lover
Basically above. Maybe merge.

## To be loved
Requires vulnerability, shame resilience. Openness to authenticity, excellent communication, awareness of ourselves and ability to convery this information to the lover. My desire to be loved (more accurately - my desire to be desired, to avoid loneliness, to be validated) sometimes trumps my desire to be authentic. It is my responsibility as the beloved to keep this desire in check. To be the beloved requires living and communicating as authentically as possible. When I deviate from this I am dishonest toward the lover.

## Why is it so hard to love ourselves?
To love ourselves is to dance as both the lover and the beloved.
Perhaps to love ourselves is not natural. The social reward is low, or may not be well formulated. Self-absorption does not have the visible affirmations that external relationships have which might attribute to this disadvantage, which may be why self-love is only coming to surface recently because the western social experience no longer provides the fulfillment individuals need. Perhaps until now there was no need for it. There certainly is now.

To love ourselves is to bring awareness to every unfiltered thought, action, memory that we have ever had or done. This kind of awareness requires unbridled honesty, which, contrary to belief, is uncommon in humans. Acceptance is not natural, it does not even make evolutionary sense for this to be so. It is to confront every one of our misgivings, personal failings - to properly frame these experiences for what they are and were - neither earth shattering nor significant, missing our expectations. To grieve properly, to find our

It is difficult to see ourselves for who we are, we lack the perspective to see ourselves outside our own programming. We cannot divorce ourselves. To love yourself is a responsibility from birth to death, we cannot escape our own minds. This also might be a misconception. What we find "hard" or difficult is likely to be at an extreme, which we are more likely to remember ourselves when we cannot engage in flight away from as we might with external systems. The cognition required to not only recognize but accept our intrusive thoughts, true motivations, which do not follow moral regulation as our actions do, means we have the personal responsibility to manage such a system. To preserve it. It is hard to do! We are not taught how to "know thyself". It is something we must learn for ourselves. Our minds are shaped by our completely unique set of circumstances and external environment.



Love is not self-sacrifice! The exemplary behavior of Christ, of other religious figures has no base. Love flows out of an abundance of self. It does not detract.
