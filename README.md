# YourAverageDigitalExistentialChautauqua
As I understand it, the chautauqua originated as a form of educational
entertainment to the masses. A preacher, artist, educator, or troop might tour
from town to town to share their stories in exchange for a place to stay and
maybe a meal or two. On their journey, they might expect to traverse a
multitude of terrains from the Mississippi to Oregon - the wild West.  I can't
help but imagine that, not only did these chautauquans give the road a bit of
wear, to greater effect the road must have given them some wear as well!

The internet is the unsettled West of today.  It is the source of - for all
intents and purposes - infinite wealth of information (from an optimist's
perspective). It is the stage for frictionless, high-velocity collisions of
ideas competing for crowded space in the collective mind - a zero-sum game
(from the pessimist's perspective).

Frustration because exposure can lead to circular ideas, infinite recursion

Storytelling as an art, an act of deception (possibly to deceive oneself?)
with intent for good

And so the chautauqua is a form of storytelling, but it is not a soliloquy, it
is interactive. To some degree, I believe this makes it more honest.

An idea is a plane in space, which subsequently can be viewed from any angle.

but one can only take so much critique, and so I'm claiming this as my little
haven, a brief respite from the chaos, something like a virtual fishing spot
(potentially a bad metaphor since I've never physically fished) where I can
ruminate on ideas, collaborate! but ultimately express my individuality

Why use a git repository? Isn't that disabling most users from collaborating
with your content?

- A git repository is a form of version control.  What this means is that it
logs a project history at different save points, but unlike your typical text
editor, every saved version is kept as a future branching off point. Every
branch point in this repository is publically
available, meaning revisions are visible to everyone.

Is this a subtle rebuttal aimed directly at cancel culture? Yes.
I want to illustrate the absurdity that thoughts are somehow permanent, because
while they might influence our actions at some point in time, they are to date
the most fluid form of currency we have.

Can I get to the honest truth of things?
No. This is absurd, lol. Perhaps that is the beauty of it.


To answer the question, I hope that it keeps me honest.  Our brains are not
programmed to be perfect change logs, git is.  Our brains perform routine
rationalization check ups.  What I mean by this is that every time a memory is
revisited, new context is added which alters the memory before it is returned.
It's a nasty but probably memory-optimized (in the computing sense) habit of
hitting "save" rather than "save as". To be fair, this probably keeps us sane.
I want to see progression though, I think the unnaturalness of it is
mesmerizing to digest.

And maybe I can use it as a soft intro to software development!

So here it is.  My digital chautauqua, a little slice of the internet. Welcome!
View it in its current state, see progressions over time, contribute (as simple
as a pull request!), however suits your fancy.

Cheers,

C
