Arches National Park - Aug 16, 2020

Holland, Justin, and I took on the Devil's Garden Trail - approximately a 10
mile loop exploring more remote areas of the park - or more accurately, slightly out of reach of the typical tourist's hike. The juice was worth the squeeze. This picture was taken slightly before reaching the dark angel, which was an obvious spin off for the Brother's Three Quarterly.

Kings Canyon - Oct 31, 2020

The drastic elevation change on the road to Kings Canyon gave Holland, Elly, and I quite the anxiety driving the Tesla into the remote areas of the park with limited range. And this - snapped moments before our first encounter with bears - struck me as an ephemeral moment of calm. The sounds of the meadow were overtaken by the wind, and puffs of seed packets of the native flora floated by like snow falls. We were surrounded by thousand foot cliff faces on three sides. I felt small. I had not been caught in a moment like this in quite some time. I was enraptured by the moment, truly.

Muir Woods - Oct 12, 2020

In our second attempt to visit Muir Woods (the first hope dashed by an unknown parking reservation), Tarenne and I began our search for the biggest redwood we couldn't fit our hands around. The grove was not as big as I anticipated, and the path was heavily trafficked. This downed log seemed as good as any a candidate for a top left corner shot! The composition of this one leaves something to be desired, but I found that fitting nature in the foreground is more of a challenge than anticipated.

Yosemite - Nov 1, 2020

Holland, Elly, and I took on the Yosemite Falls Trail, per my recommendation
having described it as one of the most challenging yet rewarding hikes I had
completed to date.  The falls had run dry long before, but the valley was as mesmerizing as I remembered. Numerous hawks and crows soaring overhead, the valley with a tinge of haze. At the top, we ate kettle-cooked bbq chips, peanuts, granola bars, and sour patch kids like maniacs. My tongue was numb from the sourness for a day and a half.
