# White Vans / Black Cars

## ***Q:***
> *I (26M, SEO analyst at large tech firm, >$100k/yr salary) recently moved to the city and am looking to dip my feet back into the dating world after a brief hiatus (6 months off the market, my longest relationship to date!), I am primarily interested in women. I have been noticing a lack of "traffic" to my dating profiles and socials lately... How can I give my profiles a "boost" per se? Dating is a numbers game for me, but I'm trying to find the one! - Brennan, New York, NY*

Brennan, first of all - incredibly grateful for your question. I know a lot of men new to the city who find themselves in the same boat.

### How to become attractive in two easy steps - neither of which requires developing your personality.



I'm going to introduce you to a concept in evolutionary biology - it's called costly signalling. Take, for example, the male peacock - he has this ornate, vivid tail which he uses to distinguish himself - to other peacocks, peafowl, and predators!  Inclination says this sort of ornate beauty should be eliminated through natural selection, but it persists! Why? It is tough to distinguish what makes a quality mate from a purely visual perspective. So how can one make themselves more noticeable?

It's like playing with an additional impediment. If you can succeed under more strenuous conditions, you are a quality peacock.

Back to reality - how can you subtly display that you are a quality human male? How do you get around the city? I'm specifially referring to your wheels (car) and what's on your feet (shoes) If you have a car - make it black. Why? A car with black paint mirrors dirt and dust making it the most obvious when your ride is in need of a wash. However, a *clean* black car displays the utmost level of upkeep.
A pair of white vans, likewise, displays your dominion over the streets.
